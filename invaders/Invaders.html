        <h4>Frances Moore Lappe</h4>
        <h5>-author of "Diet for a Small Planet"</h5>
        <p><q>Every aspect of our lives is, in a sense, a vote for the kind of world we want to live in.</q></p>
        <h4>Dr. Sylvia Earle</h4>
        <h5>-oceanographer and author of "The World is Blue"</h5>
        <p><q>Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume. Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea.</q></p>
         <h4>Wangari Maathai</h4>
        <h5>-Nobel Peace Prize Laureate winner and author of "Unbowed"</h5>
        <p><q>I don't think you need a diploma to plant a tree.</q></p>
        <h4>Ban Ki-moon</h4>
        <h5>-South Korean leader</h5>
        <p><q> Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.</q></p>
        <h4>Elon Musk</h4>
        <h5>-American businessman</h5>
        <p><q>We're running the most dangerous experiment in history right now, which is to see how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere can handle before there is an environmental catastrophe.</q></p>
        <h4>Andrew Well</h4>
        <h5>-American Scientist</h5>
        <p><q> We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.</q></p>
        <h4>Muhammad Yunus</h4>
        <h5>-economist</h5>
        <p><q> Unprecendented technological capabilties combined with unlimited human creativity have given us tremendous power to take on intractable problems like poverty, unemployment, disease and environmental degradation. Our challenge is to trasnlate this extraordinary potential into meaningful change.</q></p>
        <h4>Gaylord Nelson</h4>
        <h5>-American politician</h5>
        <p><q>The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.</q></p>
        <h4>Jello Biafra</h4>
        <h5>-american musician</h5>
        <p><q> I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organization can't be bother to man the front lines of environmental protest.</q></p>
        <h4>David Filo</h4>
        <h5>-American bussinessman</h5>
        <p><q>Fundamentally, if you lok at where the environmental issues are coming from, it's all beacuse of humans and our impact on the environment, so while it's true that one individual is not going to sufficiently fix the environment, it is a necessary thing.</q></p>

        <p>Edible non-native species give you the opportunity to expand your palate and help save your local ecosystem! Why bring in more exotics to solve the problem when the best solution is probably sitting on a comfy couch reading this?</p>
        <p>Please remember that buying factory farmed varieties of these species does no good for the environment. Make sure the business you're purchasing your aliens from follows sustainable practices...Or better yet get out there and hunt these babies down yourself!</p>
