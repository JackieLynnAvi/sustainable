        <h3>Go Green</h3>
        <h4>Frances Moore Lappe</h4>
        <h5>-author of "Diet for a Small Planet"</h5>
        <p><q>Every aspect of our lives is, in a sense, a vote for the kind of world we want to live in.</q></p>
        <h4>Dr. Sylvia Earle</h4>
        <h5>-oceanographer and author of "The World is Blue"</h5>
        <p><q>Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume. Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea.</q></p>
         <h4>Wangari Maathai</h4>
        <h5>-Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and author of "Unbowed"</h5>
        <p><q>I don't think you 
        need a diploma to plant a tree.</q></p>
         <h4>Ban Ki-moon</h4>
        <h5>-South Korean leader</h5>
        <p><q> Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.</q></p>
        <h4>Elon Musk</h4>
        <h5>-American businessman</h5>
        <p><q>We're running the most dangerous experiment in history right now, which is to see how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere can handle before there is an environmental catastrophe.</q></p>
        <h4>Andrew Well</h4>
        <h5>-American Scientist</h5>
        <p><q> We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.</q></p>
        <h4>Gaylord Nelson</h4>
        <h5>-American politician</h5>
        <p><q>The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.</q></p>

        <h1>SHRINK YOUR FOOTPRINT</h1>
        <div class ="random"><p>When it comes to our carbon footprints most of us on this island would need shoes fit for Bigfoot. Get informed, make conscious decisions.</p></div>
        <span class ="center"><a href = "http://www.nature.org/greenliving/carboncalculator/" target="_blank"> Calculate your carbon footprint here!</a></span>
        <h2> Reduce.</h2><span class = "right"><img src ="../images/youseethedifference.png" alt = "Jellies and Plastic Bags"></span>
        <p> -BYOB, Bring Your Own Bag</p>
        <p> -Go topless! Most lids are made of #6 plastic, polystyrene, more commonly known as styrofoam. It contains carcinogens and is a bitch to try to recycle on our little island. So "free the nipple" or whatever and ditch your tops.</p>
        <p>-Eat the uglies, bruised produce needs love too.</p> 
        <p>-Help stop mindless food waste, this is what the common expiration dates actually mean:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SELL BY</strong>- stores can't display the product for sale after this date but it is still good for 7-10 days after this date. Meat should be frozen on or before this date but it is ok to defrost and eat it at a later date, <em>not a safety date</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>BEST IF USED BY (OR BEFORE)</strong>-recommended date for best flavor or quality, <em>not a safety date</em>. Use your best judgement.</li>
          <li><strong>USE-BY</strong>-reccomnded date for use of the product while at peak quality determined by the manufacturer, <em>not a safety date</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>EXPIRATION DATE</strong>-refers to the last date the product should be eaten or used. After this day proceed at your own risk and discretion.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>-If it's broken, try to fix it. You don't always need NEW.</p>
        <p>-Bike or Walk, it's not that far, you're not that lazy.</p>
        <p>-Give a hoot don't pollute! You will pass a trash receptacle somewhere in the near future. Hold onto your garbage, or your cigarette butts won't be the only thing hitting the curb.</p>
        <p>-Carving your initials into living bark spells O-U-C-H for the tree. If you must leave your mark, do so on a fallen tree. Trees shouldn't have to die with your crappy relationship.</p>
        <p>-Buy less products with packaging</p>
        <p>-Stop balloon releases! The balloons will eventually land and damage our environment and kill countless animals. Even latex ballons labeled as biodegradable cause plenty of damage in the 6 months-4 years it takes them to decompose.</p>
        <p>-Use less water and eletricity. Skip a shower or two, use natural lighting if it's daytime. Turn it off if you're not using it!</p> 
        <p>-Eliminate or minimize your participation in animal agriculture through consumption. 
        A 2006 study by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) finds that 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions is directly attributable to livestock production, which is more than the emissions attributable to the entire transportation sector.</p>
      <h2>Reuse.</h2>
        <p>-Say no to disposables, ask for reusuable utensils or bring your own.</p>
        <p>-Upcycle, turn old materials into art</p>
        <p>-Donate clothes and electronics to friends or appropriate drop off bins</p>
        <p>-Donate food, including expired items to local food drives. <a href="http://lifnb.com/" target="_blank">Long Island Food Not Bombs</a> is a great vegetarian food drive with locations across the island.</p>
        <p>-Make your stale bread into croutons or breadcrumbs to use at a later date, stop feeding it to the ducks. Feeding ducks bread contributes to duckling malnutrition, overcrowding, pollution, and diseases. Great foods to feed ducks includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>-halfed grapes, strawberries tops and all, broccoli, stalks included</li>
        <li>-cracked corn, barley, oats, birdseed or other grains</li>
        <li>-frozen peas or corn kernels that have been defrosted</li>
        <li>-duck feed pellets available from farm supply stores</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recycle.</h2>
        <p>Known how, when, and where to recycle on this island!</p>
        <table style="width:100%; border-spacing:0;">
          <tr><th>Plastic Type</th><th style ="text-align:center">Where to Recycle</th></tr>
          <tr><td>#1 PET (PETE)-polyethylene terephthalate</td><td>Recycled curbside in Nassau and Suffolk County</td></tr>
          <tr><td>#2 HDPE-high-density polyethylene</td><td>Recycled curbside in Nassau and Suffolk County</td></tr>
          <tr><td>#3 V (PVC)-polyvinyl chloride</td><td>Recycled curbside in Oyster Bay, Glen Cove, Long Beach, Babylon, Riverhead, and Huntington</td></tr>

          <tr><td>#6 PS-polystyrene (STYROFOAM)</td><td>Huntington residents can bring their polystyrene, excluding utensils and food packaging to The Recycling Center at 641 New York Avenue. The Alliance of Foam Packaging Recyclers offers a mailback program for all US residents. If polystyrene is something you get a lot of, you might be able to sell it at Recycled Plastic Markets Database</td></tr>
          <tr><td>#7 OTHER (or unmarked)-Any plastic other than 1-6, or mixed</td><td>Many #7 plastics can’t be recycled due to their composition. #7 water bottles can be recycled curbside in Oyster Bay, Glen Cove, Long Beach, Babylon, Riverhead and Huntington</td></tr>

       <p>Most towns follow a  pick-up shcedule of bottles and cans alternating every Wednesday with pick-up of papers, except during holiday weeks when they will be picked up on your regular garbage day (Thursday or Friday). A quick internet search will provide you with a digital copy of your town's schedule.</p>
